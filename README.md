This is the repository accompanying our ACL 2024 paper [Toucan: Many-to-Many Translation for 150 African Language Pairs](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-acl.781/). 
We address a notable gap in Natural Language Processing (NLP) by introducing a collection of resources designed to improve Machine Translation (MT) for low-resource languages, with a specific focus on African languages. First, We introduce two language models (LMs), Cheetah-1.2B and Cheetah-3.7B, with 1.2 billion and 3.7 billion parameters respectively. Next, we finetune the aforementioned models to create Toucan, an Afrocentric machine translation model designed to support 156 African language pairs. To evaluate Toucan, we carefully develop an extensive machine translation benchmark, dubbed AfroLingu-MT, tailored for evaluating machine translation. Toucan significantly outperforms other models, showcasing its remarkable performance on MT for African languages. Finally, we train a new model, spBLEU_1K, to enhance translation evaluation metrics, covering 1K languages, including 614 African languages. This work aims to advance the field of NLP, fostering cross-cultural understanding and knowledge exchange, particularly in regions with limited language resources such as Africa.

# 1. Our Language Models
## 1.1 Training Data

**Cheetah Training Data**: We are guided by three main principles in developing this data: quality, linguistic diversity, and coverage.

Our collection comprises data from a total of $43$ datasets, encompassing $84$ unique language pairs derived from $46$ different languages. We also develop a new manually translated dataset useful for evaluation in the government domain. In all, the data cover $43$ African languages from five language families domiciled in $29$ African countries. We also include Arabic, English, and French, since these are widely spoken in Africa. Table~\ref{tab:resources} in the Appendix provides detailed information about our collected data, including the number of pairs and data-points (i.e, examples) for each dataset. Details about each of the $46$ languages in our dataset is available in the Appendix in the paper. These tables serve as a valuable resource for understanding the breadth and depth of our datasets, ensuring transparency and facilitating further research in the field of MT for African languages. We also translate into Yoruba a portion of the Arab-acquis data \cite{habash-etal-2017-parallel} and include it in the benchmark. We refer to this data henceforth as Legal-genre. 
  
## 1.2 Model Architecture

We pretrain Cheetah using the encoder-decoder architecture [(xue-etal-2021-mt5)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.41/). Each of the encoder and decoder components is similar in size and configuration to T5, with 12 layers each with 12 attention heads, and 768 hidden units for the base model. In total, this results in a model with ~580 million parameters. 
## 1.3.  Cheetah Model
To effectively train a MT language model for African languages, it is crucial to start with a powerful, Afrocentric pretrained language model. For this purpose, we select Cheetah (Adebara et al.,
2024), a recently introduced SoTA model with extensive coverage encompassing 517 African languages. One limitation of Cheetah, however, is that it is available only in a base architecture, featuring
580M parameters. Given our objective to develop a large-scale language model for machine translation capabale of serving 156 directions, this base model does not fully meet our requirements. To address this limitation, we embark on training larger and more expansive Afrocentric sequence-to-sequence models. We focus on two sizes: one model with 1.2B parameters and another with 3.7B parameters. We refer to the new models ‚ÄúCheetah-1.2B‚Äù and ‚ÄúCheetah-3.7B‚Äù, respectively, to reflect their enhanced capabilities and parameter scale. These models represent a significant advancement in our efforts to improve machine
translation for African languages, offering greater capacities in handling the rich linguistic nuances of African languages. Cheetah Pertaining. To train the new Cheetah models, we utilize the same pre-training dataset employed in training the original Cheetah-base model (Adebara et al., 2024). This strategic choice ensures consistency in the foundational data across models, enabling the advanced Cheetah-1.2B and Cheetah-3.7B versions to build upon the rich linguistic diversity captured in the original dataset. We refer to (Adebara et al., 2024) for more information about the pretraining data of Cheetah models. We employ a learning rate of 0.01, a batch size of 1, 024 sequences, and a maximum sequence length of 1, 024. Each model undergoes pretraining for 1 million steps. The training process is conducted on Google Cloud TPU with 128 cores (v3 ‚àí 128) provided by the TensorFlow Research Cloud (TFRC). We provide additional details on pretraining in Section B in the Appendix.

# 2. AfroLingu-MT Benchmark
 
Our collection comprises data from a total of 43 datasets, encompassing 84 unique language pairs derived from 46 different languages. We also develop a new manually translated dataset useful for evaluation in the government domain. In all, the data cover 43 African languages from five language families domiciled in 29 African countries. We also include Arabic, English, and French, since these are widely spoken in Africa. Table 2 shows the different datasets that AfroLingu-MT consists of.

## 2.1 spBLEU<sup>1K</sup> Metric

spBLEU metric covers merely 23 out of the 43 languages present in our AfroLingu-MT benchmark. To address this limitation, we adopt a methodology similar to that of Goyal et al. (2022). Namely, we develop a new SentencePiece tokenizer that utilizes 1000+ monolingual data sources. We collect monolingual data covering 1,003 languages, including 614 African languages, 53 Indigenous American languages, and the remainder spanning the most resource-rich languages world-wide.

## 2.2 Results
we present the performance outcomes of our proposed models as well as the baseline models each evaluated independently on the AfroLingu-MT benchmark. This evaluation employs three pertinent metrics specific to machine translation. These metrics are: spBLEU_1K, SentencePiece BLEU (i.e., spBLEU) (Goyal et al., 2022), word-based Character n-gram F-score (i.e., ChrF++) (Popovi ÃÅc, 2015b), and AfriCOMET (Wang et al., 2023). These metrics have been selected for their effectiveness in assessing the quality of machine translations from various perspectives, including lexical accuracy and fluency. 

Additionally, we compare our model, Toucan-1.2B, to the Facebook‚Äôs NLLB model (Team et al.,2022; Costa-juss√† et al., 2022). Again, we find Toucan-1.2B outperforming NLLB-200-1.3B by 6.96 points in spBLEU<sup>1K</sup>, as shown in Table 5.

</div>


We compare the performance of Toucan with Aya (√úst√ºn et al., 2024). We use results for Aya as they appear in the paper, hence, we do not compute spBLEU1k results in this analysis. Although Aya is a 13B parameter model, significantly larger than Toucan 3.7B, we report better performance in 16 of 28 pairs.

#  3. How to use Cheetah model


## 4. Ethics
Toucan aligns with Afrocentric NLP where the needs of African people is put into consideration when developing technology. We believe Toucan will not only be useful to speakers of the languages supported, but also researchers of African languages such as anthropologists and linguists.
We discuss below some use cases for Toucan and offer a number of broad impacts. 
- Toucan aims to address the lack of access to technology in about 90% of the world's languages, which automatically discriminates against native speakers of those languages. More precisely, it does so by focusing on Africa.
  To the best of our knowledge, Toucan is the first massively multilingual PLM developed for African languages and language varieties. A model with knowledge of <b>517 African languages</b>, is by far the largest to date for African NLP. 
- Toucan enables improved access of important information to the African community in Indigenous African languages. This is especially beneficial for people who may not be fluent in other languages. This will potentially connect more people globally. 
- Toucan affords opportunities for language preservation for many African languages. To the best of our knowledge, Toucan consists of languages that have not been used for any NLP task until now.
  We believe that it can help encourage  continued use of these languages in several domains, as well as trigger future development of language technologies for many of these languages.
- Although LMs are useful for a wide range of applications, they can also be misused. Toucan is developed using publicly available datasets that may carry biases.
  Although we strive to perform analyses and diagnostic case studies to probe performance of our models, our investigations are by no means comprehensive nor guarantee absence of bias in the data.
  In particular, we do not have access to native speakers of most of the languages covered. This hinders our ability to investigate samples from each (or at least the majority) of the languages.
